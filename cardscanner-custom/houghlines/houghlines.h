@function HoughLineDetector
@brief Custom C++ implementation of the Hough Line detection algorithm.
For HOUGH_LINE_STANDARD, the line points might fall outside of the image.
STANDARD EXAMPLE:
`HoughLineDetector(src, w, h, scaleX, scaleY, 70, 150, 1, PI / 180, 0, PI, 100,
                  HOUGH_LINE_STANDARD, bbox, lines)`
PROBABILISTIC EXAMPLE:
`HoughLineDetector(src, w, h, scaleX, scaleY, 70, 150, 1, PI / 180, 30, 10, 80,
                  HOUGH_LINE_PROBABILISTIC, bbox, lines)`

@param [in] src: image, single channel
@param [in] w: width of image
@param [in] h: height of image
@param [in] scaleX: downscale factor in X-axis
@param [in] scaleY: downscale factor in Y-axis
@param [in] CannyLowThresh: lower threshold for hysteresis procedure in canny
@param [in] CannyHighThresh: higher threshold for hysteresis procedure in canny
@param [in] HoughRho: distance resolution of the accumulator in pixels
@param [in] HoughTheta: angle resolution of the accumulator in radians
@param [in] MinThetaLinelength:
STANDARD: for standard and multi-scale hough transform, minimum angle to check
for lines. PROBABILISTIC: minimum line length, line segments shorter than that
are rejected.
@param [in] MaxThetaGap:
STANDARD: for standard and multi-scale hough transform, maximum angle to check
for lines. PROBABILISTIC: maximum allowed gap between points on the same line to
link them.
@param [in] HoughThresh: accumulator threshold parameter, only lines that get
enough votes are returned ( >threshold )
@param [in] _type: HOUGH_LINE_STANDARD or HOUGH_LINE_PROBABILISTIC
@param [in] bbox: boundingbox or region to detect the lines in
@param [in/out] lines: detected lines are returned in this vector
@result [int] 0: success; 1: error
