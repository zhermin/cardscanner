# CardScanner v0.1 Python POC

This folder contains the first version of the Card Corner Detector written in Python and OpenCV. Experiements using more complicated algorithms found only in OpenCV are done here. If the algorithms are effective, then either open-source or custom implementations in C++ will have to be sourced to be able to be deployed on mobile.

Later versions of the SDK were written in C++ and are available in the `cardscanner-custom` folder, where the main logic is in `card_corner_detector.cpp`.
